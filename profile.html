<h1 class="about-me-header-main">About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Hamal. I am from New York. I am currently trying to learn Web Development.</p>
<h2 class= "skills-interests-header">Skills & Interests</h2>

<p>I would describe myself as a jack of all trades master of none. Many years ago, I was an apprentice carpenter. My skills in carpentry have deteriorated over time, but I like to think I still have some humble bragging rights. I enjoy singing and listening to music. My skill level in singing is yet to be decided, although the hula girl on my bathroom sink jams out to my homemade tunes frequently. For the past 7 years I was a volunteer audio technician/editor, recordist, and voice actor for Watchtower BT Society (Jehovah's Witnesses). I developed skill using Pro Tools and Final Cut Pro. In addition to those grown up things, I love playing sports video games, such as Fifa, Madden, NBA 2K and MLB The Show. I am not skilled in these games but I enjoy them nonetheless. Being a native New Yorker, I am also an avid supporter of my NY sports teams. Lets go Yankees, Giants, Knicks and Rangers!</p>

<h2 class="career-goals-header">Career Goals</h2>
<p>
    I have known and done construction all my life and although it has been rewarding, I want to take the next step and move into a growing fiel, in which I can continue to learn and express my creativity with. I have enjoyed learning prgramming so far. It has been an amazing experience and it has only made me want to push myself further and keep on learning. My ideal job would be something mostly remote or hybrid. I want to make software engineering my career. I also want to have the flexibility to travel and explore new places. Tech is the future and I am honored to be a part of the reform.
