<h1 class="about-me-header-main">About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Hamal. I am from New York. I am currently trying to learn Web Development.</p>
<h2 class= "skills-interests-header">Skills & Interests</h2>
<p>I would describe myself as a jack of all trades master of none. Many years ago, I was an apprentice carpenter. My skills in carpentry have deteriorated over time, but I like to think I still have some humble bragging rights. I enjoy singing and listening to music. My skill level in singing is yet to be decided, although the hula girl on my bathroom sink jams out to my homemade tunes frequently. For the past 7 years I was a volunteer audio technician/editor, recordist, and voice actor for Watchtower BT Society (Jehovah's Witnesses). I developed skill using Pro Tools and Final Cut Pro. In addition to those grown up things, I love playing sports video games, such as Fifa, Madden, NBA 2K and MLB The Show. I am not skilled in these games but I enjoy them nonetheless. Being a native New Yorker I am also an avid supporter of my NY sports teams. Lets go Yankees, Giants, Knicks and Rangers!</p>
